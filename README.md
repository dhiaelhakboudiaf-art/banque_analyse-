Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of credit risk and non-performing loans within a banking context.
Using structured datasets and visual analytics, the project aims to identify risk concentration, portfolio weaknesses, and structural inefficiencies in credit management and recovery strategies.

The analysis is purely analytical and academic, intended for educational and professional demonstration purposes.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the distribution of credit risk across organizational units

Identify concentration risks related to large exposures

Study the behavior of distressed portfolios

Evaluate risk segmentation and provisioning logic

Provide data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas for data cleaning and transformation

Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for analysis workflow

📈 Analysis Components

The project includes:

Portfolio segmentation analysis

Risk concentration diagnostics

Comparative performance analysis

Visualization of risk categories

Temporal evolution of credit quality

Identification of structurally vulnerable exposures

All visualizations are generated programmatically to ensure reproducibility and clarity.

📊 Visualizations

The repository contains multiple graphs illustrating:

Risk distribution across entities

Concentration of exposures

Portfolio health indicators

Evolution of distressed assets

⚠️ Note:
Graphs are presented without explicit values to preserve confidentiality while highlighting trends and patterns.

🔒 Data Privacy & Confidentiality

No sensitive identifiers are disclosed

No exact figures are mentioned

All datasets are anonymized

The project respects professional and ethical data-handling standards

This repository is safe for public sharing.

🧠 Key Insights

Credit risk tends to be highly concentrated rather than evenly distributed

A small subset of exposures can heavily influence overall portfolio health

Preventive risk management is more effective than late-stage recovery

Portfolio diversification plays a critical role in risk mitigation
